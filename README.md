### ElasticSearch
- Will be used to storage Log content

### LogStash
- Are configurated to **create** ```ApplicationLog``` *queue* on ```EnterpriseLog``` *virtual host* and listen this queue
- Every message in ```EnterpriseLog/ApplicationLog``` will be send to ```ElasticSearch```

### Kibana
- Was configurated to read data from ```ElasticSearch```
- Use **[http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601/)** for management Kibana without credentials

### Beats
- Monitoring and collecting metrics from ```Docker Daemon```, ```ElasticSearch``` and ```RabbitMQ```.
- Automatic setup some dashboards to show these metrics
